"""Smoke tests for #122 DB wiring.

These tests are skipped when DATABASE_URL is unset so local dev / CI without a
Postgres instance stays green. When DATABASE_URL is set (Render, or a local
dev DB), they verify:

  1. The async engine connects and round-trips a trivial query.
  2. The alembic head matches what's recorded in the versions/ directory.
