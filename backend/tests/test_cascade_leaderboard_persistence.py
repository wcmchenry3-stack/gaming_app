"""#366: cascade leaderboard survives across engine dispose + reload.

The in-memory leaderboard that preceded #366 lost every score on restart.
This test exercises the DB-backed replacement by:
  1. Creating and completing a game via the unified games pipeline
  2. Disposing the engine pool (proxy for a process restart)
  3. Re-opening a fresh TestClient and asserting the score is still visible

Uses a dedicated SQLite file so the autouse clean_db_tables fixture in
conftest.py does NOT wipe the row (we disable that fixture for this module).
