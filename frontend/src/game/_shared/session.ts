/**
 * Per-device session ID management.
 *
 * Every game sends its session ID as the `X-Session-ID` header so the
 * backend can isolate game state per client without requiring user
 * accounts. The ID is generated once per device and persisted in
 * AsyncStorage.
 *
 * This used to live in the Yacht client (`frontend/src/api/client.ts`)
 * which all other clients reached into. Moved to _shared during the
 * unified game module refactor (#153).
