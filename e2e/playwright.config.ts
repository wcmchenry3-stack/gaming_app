/**
 * Playwright E2E configuration.
 *
 * Named projects allow CI to run only the impacted game suite on dev PRs
 * while always running the full suite on main PRs / pushes.
 *
 * Projects:
 *   yacht       — yacht-*.spec.ts
 *   blackjack   — blackjack-*.spec.ts
 *   twenty48    — twenty48-*.spec.ts
 *   mahjong     — mahjong-*.spec.ts
 *   freecell    — freecell-*.spec.ts
 *   cross       — accessibility.spec.ts, cascade-flow.spec.ts, ui-preferences.spec.ts
 *   logs-budget — logs-*.spec.ts (#373 acceptance gate, CPU-throttled to
 *                  approximate mid-tier mobile device performance)
 *
 * In CI the e2e job passes --project flags based on dorny/paths-filter output.
 * Locally, `npx playwright test` runs all projects (no --project flag needed).
 *
 * The webServer serves the pre-built Expo Web static export from
 * frontend/dist/.  In CI the build step runs separately before this job.
 * Locally, run `cd frontend && npx expo export --platform web` once first.
