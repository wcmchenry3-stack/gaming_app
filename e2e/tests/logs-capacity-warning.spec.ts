/**
 * #484 scenario 6 — Capacity warning UX.
 *
 * The last e2e scenario from the #373 acceptance gate (scenario 13 is
 * deferred to #486). Drives the real CapacityWarningToast component
 * that landed in #483.
 *
 * Flow:
 *   1. Override MAX_ROWS=100 and pin CAPACITY_WARNING_SUPPRESS_MS to a
 *      value that outlives the test so the 24h suppression actually
 *      gates on our dismiss event instead of racing wall clock.
 *   2. Seed 82 rows (82% fill) — crosses the 80% warning ratio.
 *   3. Wait for the toast's next poll cycle (the test build uses a
 *      500 ms interval instead of the production 30 s).
 *   4. Assert the toast becomes visible.
 *   5. Click Dismiss — markWarningShown() fires and activates the
 *      suppression window.
 *   6. Seed 10 more rows (92% fill — well above the threshold).
 *   7. Wait two poll cycles and assert the toast does NOT reappear.
 *
 * The test runs inside a single withLogConfigOverride block so any
 * failure path restores defaults on exit.
