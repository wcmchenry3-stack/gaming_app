/**
 * #481 scenario 9 — Crash recovery.
 *
 * Seeds 50 events into the queue without flushing, then "crashes" the
 * page via page.reload(). Asserts the seeded rows are still in the
 * queue on the next load. With the network online (default 200), the
 * next flush drains the queue cleanly.
 *
 * AsyncStorage is persisted by the browser (localStorage under the
 * hood in Expo Web), so reload preserves it as long as Playwright
 * doesn't clear storage between navigations — which it doesn't within
 * a single `page` instance.
